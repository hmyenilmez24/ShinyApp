# ShinyApp-with-R
Development of Statistical Analytics App

An application has been developed for the real dataset “LungCap Dataset” to show descriptive analytics. 
Entire code is embedded in a single app.R with ui and server codes.

Side Panel consists of: Sidebar panel, Dropdown box, Radio Buttons

Main Panel consists of: Plot, Summary, Table

* Descriptive analytics techniques:
-> Box Plot:

-> Density Curve:

* Probabilistic models: 
-> Discrete (Binomial Distribution):
